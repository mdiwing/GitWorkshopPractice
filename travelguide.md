### Haltiala Farm - out door day

There is a nice farm with a beer garden at the river bordering Helsinki and
Vantaa. It is towards NE, the airport. I often combine the visit to some
outdoor day, there is nice forest parks and river walks near by the farm. At
winter it has great skiing tracks. Why not go do some sport for some hours in
nature, and have dinner and beers at the farm!
